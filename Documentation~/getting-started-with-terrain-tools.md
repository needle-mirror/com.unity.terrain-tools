# Getting started with Terrain Tools

You should read the [built-in Terrain documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Terrain.html) before you use the Terrain Tools package. Terrain Tools provides add-on tooling, which means it modifies and improves Unity's built-in set of Terrain features. Below are some examples of these advanced features.

For information about how to install Terrain Tools and Asset Samples, see [Installing Terrain Tools and Sample Assets](installing-terrain-tools.md).

## Paint Terrain

Terrain Tools adds fourteen new tools to the Paint Terrain drop-down menu, which include several [Sculpting](sculpt.md), [Erosion](erosion.md), and [Transform](transform.md) tools, [Mesh Stamping](mesh-stamp.md), and upgraded [Texture Painting](paint-texture.md) and [Terrain Stamping](stamp-terrain.md) experiences.

## Paint Details

Terrain Tools adds updates to the Paint Detail tool. These updates include the addition of enhanced [brush controls](brush-controls-shortcut-keys.md), the ability to scatter multiple details simultaneously, and a new Layer filtering mode. 

## Brushes

Terrain Tools adds updates to [Brush controls](brush-controls-shortcut-keys.md) and [Brush Mask Filters](brush-mask-filters.md) to enhance Terrain brushes. The new Brush controls rename **Opacity** to **Brush Strength**, and add the ability to set **Brush Rotation**, **Brush Spacing**, and **Brush Scatter**. You can also modify the maximum and minimum values of each Brush.

## Terrain Toolbox

The [Terrain Toolbox](terrain-toolbox.md) is a utility window that contains useful tools to help simplify Terrain workflows. It allows you to create new Terrain from preset settings or imported heightmaps, batch change Terrain settings on multiple Terrain tiles, and import/export splatmaps and heightmaps.

## Noise Editor

The [Noise Editor](noise-editor.md) is a standalone window that lets you author and save noise patterns for the [Noise Height](sculpt-noise.md) tool. This allows you to work on **Noise Setting** assets without the need to have the Brush active and potentially modifying your Terrain.
