# Smooth Height

Use the **Smooth Height** tool to smooth the [heightmap](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/terrain-Heightmaps.html) and soften Terrain features. Smoothing is particularly useful after you paint with brushes that contain high frequency patterns. These brush patterns tend to introduce sharp, jagged edges into a landscape, but you can use the Smooth Height tool to soften that roughness.

**Note:** This tool overrides the built-in [Smooth Height](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/terrain-SmoothHeight.html) and adds two new parameters, **Verticality** and **Blur Radius**, which provide finer control when smoothing your Terrain.

To select the Stamp Terrain tool:
1. Select a Terrain tile to bring up the Terrain Inspector. 
2. In the **Terrain Inspector**, click the **Paint Terrain** icon.
3. Select **Smooth Height** from the drop-down menu.

To use the Smooth Height tool, select it and then drag the mouse across Terrain areas that youâ€™d like to smooth. Smoothing the Terrain averages out nearby areas, softening the landscape and reducing the appearance of abrupt changes.

## Parameters

| **Property**    | **Description** |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| **Verticality** | Defines the direction in which to smooth the Terrain. The default value is 0, which smoothens the Terrain toward an average height of the highest and lowest extremities.<br /><br />**Negative values**<br />Set the value to -1 to smooth the Terrain in a downward direction, or set a value between -1 and 0 to partially smooth it in the downward direction. The lower the **Verticality** value, the more Unity smooths a Terrain in the downward direction.<br /><br />**Positive values**<br />Set the value to 1 to smooth the Terrain in an upward direction, or set a value between -0 and 1 to partially smooth it in the upward direction. The greater the **Verticality** value, the more Unity smooths a Terrain in the upward direction. |
| **Blur Radius** | Specifies the size of the blurring operation in Texture space. The minimum value of 1 is default, and the maximum value you can set is equal to half of the Terrain's heightmap resolution.<br /><br />The **Blur Radius** determines the number of texels to include in the blur sample average. Set a larger **Blur Radius** to use a bigger area to sample the Terrain during smoothing.  |
