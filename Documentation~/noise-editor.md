# Noise Editor

The **Noise Editor** allows you to author and manage Noise Settings Assets, which you can use in the [Noise Height Tool](sculpt-noise.md) and [Noise Brush Mask Filters](brush-mask-filters-list.md#noise). You can also use the Noise Editor to generate procedural textures.

To open the Noise Editor, select **Window** > **Terrain** > **Edit Noise** from the menu.
