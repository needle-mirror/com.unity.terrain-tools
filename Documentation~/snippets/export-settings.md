| **Texture Type**    | There are two available modes.<br/>&#8226; **Texture 2D**: Writes to an image format such as `.png`.<br/>&#8226; **Texture 3D**: Writes to an `.asset`, which Unity reads in as a 3D Texture. |
| **Dimensions**     | Texture size, where **X** is width and **Y** is height. If you set the **Export Mode** to Texture3D, a third option for **Z** appears. This is the number of "slices" to use when Unity generates the 3D Texture. |
| **Texture Format** | A list of [Graphics Formats](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.html) supported by Unity for 2D image export. |
