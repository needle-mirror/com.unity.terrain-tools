Warp Settings apply turbulence to the noise. Turbulence refers to the random and chaotic n-dimensional vorticity that Unity applies to the input positions of the noise domain space.

| **Property**   | **Description**                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Iterations** | The number of turbulence iterations to apply.                |
| **Strength**   | The magnitude of the turbulence.                             |
| **Offset**     | The four-dimensional offset direction of the turbulence in the noise. Depending on the number of dimensions to the noise, Unity uses different combinations of the **Offset** vector components when applying the offset during domain output calculations. |
