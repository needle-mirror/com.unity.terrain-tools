The Transform Settings move the noise domain space in the order of **Translate**, **Rotate**, and **Scale**.

| **Property**    | **Description**                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Translation** | Moves the center space of the noise from one location to another. Unity applies this translation value to the input positions of the domain space that the noise uses to generate its output values. You can also perform this operation by clicking and dragging the **Noise Field Preview**. |
| **Rotation**    | Rotates around the origin of the noise domain, which Unity uses the **Translation** value to determine. Unity applies this rotation value to the input positions of the domain space that the noise uses to generate its output values. |
| **Scale**       | The size of the input domain space. Unity applies this scaling factor to the input positions of the domain space that the noise uses to generate its output values. You can also perform this operation by placing the cursor on the **Noise Field Preview** and moving the wheel button. |
| **Flip Scale**  | Use these buttons to flip the scale of the noise on the X, Y, and Z axes relative to the center of the **Noise Field Preview**.<br/><br/>&#8226; **X**: Flips the patterns on the right side of the preview to the left, and flips those on the left side to the right.<br/>&#8226; **Y**: Flips the patterns on the top of the preview to the bottom, and flips those on the bottom to the top.<br/>&#8226; **Z**: There's no visible effect because the preview is a 2D slice of the noise domain. However, similar to a Camera's Z axis, you can think of it as flipping an infinite pattern that goes into and out of the preview. |
