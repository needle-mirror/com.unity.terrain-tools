# Change and apply settings

All the Terrain Settings in the wizard are identical to the Terrain Settings in the Inspector. See [Terrain settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/terrain-OtherSettings.html) for more information about each setting.

However, in the Terrain Toolbox, settings are split into sections that you can enable or disable for better batch processing. When you apply changes in the Toolbox, Unity only updates the settings in enabled sections. Use the checkbox on each section's expander menu to enable or disable its group of settings.
