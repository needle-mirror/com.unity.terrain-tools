## [4.0.3] - 2021-09-29
### Fixed:
- Fixed different line endings in NoiseLib.cs.

### Changed:
- No longer creating a material asset for Terrain visualization.

## [4.0.2] - 2021-09-29

## [4.0.1] - 2021-09-27
### Changed:
- Modified include path in builtin visualization shader.

## [4.0.0] - 2021-09-01
### Added:
- Added Brush Mask Filter previews to all Paint Terrain tools.
- Added the option to let you set default parameter values for Brushes.
- Added a warning message (specifically for Vulkan and DX12) about Brush sizes and heightmaps that are possibly too large to allocate in GPU memory.

### Changed:
- Improved Brush preview feedback when you paint holes to make it more obvious which parts of the Terrain the Paint Holes tool affects.
- Changed Noise Editor window behavior so that when you open the Noise Editor window, Unity opens an existing Noise Editor window instead of creating a new one.
- Changed the way Unity handles NaN and INF input for the transform values of Noise Settings.
- Changed the Paint Height tool's Brush Strength slider range to cover more usable values, and changed the default Brush Strength on various other tools.
- Improved Brush descriptions for standardization, and to make the descriptions for different sculpting brushes easier to understand.
- Moved Mesh Stamp tool features into the Stamp Terrain tool.
- Moved Terrain Toolbox warnings from the Console to the Inspector window.

### Fixed:
- Fixed RenderTexture leak in `ToolboxHelper.CopyTextureToTerrainHeight`.
- Fixed an exception that occurred when you specified an empty directory path in the Export Splatmaps or Export Heightmaps tool.
- Fixed serialization errors in the Noise Editor when you reload scenes.
- Fixed the Terrain Toolbox window so that it scales properly when docked.
- Fixed the Terrain Toolbox folder path GUI so that it now sizes correctly and consistently.
- Constrained Terrain splits to split equally along the X and Z axes, since heightmap resolution must be equal along the X and Z axes. (case 1358022)
- Fixed CopyTexture error due to mipcount mismatch when you added Terrain splatmaps.
- Fixed Remove Terrain so that it no longer removes child objects. It now only removes Terrain components, and leaves everything else intact. GameObjects without children nor components aren't affected.
- Fixed the Split tool so that it no longer deletes the selected Terrain GameObject. Instead, Unity removes the Terrain component, and makes the selected Terrain parent of all subtiles. Also now, you can't undo a split operation.
- Fixed an issue where the `NoiseLib` constructor required a large amount of CPU time when you entered and exited play mode, by using `TypeCache` instead.
- Fixed an issue where the split Terrain process was slow when there were many trees.

- Fixed an issue with overlapping Brush Mask Filter property fields.
- Fixed incorrect positioning of the Noise Field Preview tooltip.
- Fixed distorted reset icons.
